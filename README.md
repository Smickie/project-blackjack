 Blackjack simulation project for Nod

Greetings and welcome to our Blackjack project for Nod Bootcamp 1 2024.

This code simulates Blackjack between a dealer and one player with interactive choices for the player to stand or hit. It plays with one deck but more can be added in the code logic where the initial deck is created by simply increasing the multiplication accordingly.

Examples:
Two decks: deck = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11]*8
Three decks: deck = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11]*12
Four decks: deck = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11]*16

Remember, if you run this program, to run the cells from start to finish as the functions necessary to make the program run is in seperate cells. If you use Jypiter Notebook, on the top of the screen there is a button next to the stop and play button that look like a fast forward button. That will run all the cells, the main game code last. 

In the current code, there still isn't an option for the player to split cards or double down. Something perhaps to be added in the future. More details about challenges faced in during the project and ideas for future development can be found in the pdf presentation.
